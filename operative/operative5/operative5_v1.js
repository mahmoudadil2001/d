    answer: 1
  },
  {
    question: "Why is dentin's elasticity clinically important?",
    options: ["It makes teeth more brittle", "It provides support for brittle enamel against occlusal loads", "It reduces tooth sensitivity", "It makes cavity preparation easier"],
    answer: 1
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to fracture resistance when cavity preparation depth and width increase?",
    options: ["Fracture resistance increases", "Fracture resistance remains unchanged", "Fracture resistance significantly decreases", "Only aesthetic appearance is affected"],

  {
    question: "How can dentin be distinguished from enamel during tooth preparation based on sound?",
    options: ["Enamel produces dull sound, dentin produces sharp sound", "Both produce identical sounds", "Enamel produces sharp high-pitched sound, dentin produces dull sound", "Sound differentiation is not possible"],

  },
  {
    question: "What is the smear layer and how does it affect dentin permeability?",

  {
    question: "What is microleakage in restorative dentistry?",
    options: ["Leakage of filling material into pulp", "Diffusion of bacteria, fluids and ions at tooth-restoration interface", "Leakage of saliva into the oral cavity", "Seepage of dental materials into gums"],
    answer: 1

  {
    question: "How does remaining dentin thickness (RDT) affect pulp protection?",
    options: ["Thicker RDT increases irritation to pulp", "Thicker RDT reduces tubular diameter and length, protecting pulp", "RDT has no effect on pulp protection", "Only the quality of dentin matters, not thickness"],

  {
    question: "How do desensitizing toothpastes like those containing strontium chloride work?",
    options: ["They numb the pulp directly", "They promote intratubular crystallization to occlude tubules", "They dissolve dentinal tubules", "They stimulate reparative dentin formation"],
    answer: 1
  },
  {
    question: "What is the clinical significance of reactionary dentin formation?",
