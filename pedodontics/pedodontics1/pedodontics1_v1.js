    question: "A 2-month-old infant is brought to the clinic by concerned parents because they noticed a small, mobile tooth in the lower front region since birth. The tooth is slightly loose and has a sharp edge. The mother reports difficulty breastfeeding due to pain. What is the most appropriate initial management?",

      "Extract the tooth immediately due to aspiration risk and feeding difficulty",
      "Leave the tooth in place and monitor, as it will likely stabilize",
      "Prescribe antibiotics to prevent infection",
      "Perform root canal treatment to stabilize the tooth"

  {
    question: "A 6-year-old patient presents with a delayed eruption of the permanent mandibular first molar. Radiographs show the tooth is fully formed but remains deep in the bone.

      "Boys’ teeth usually erupt earlier than girls’",
      "Eruption timing is the same for both genders",
      "Girls’ teeth usually erupt earlier than boys’",

      "Smooth the incisal edge",
      "Leave the tooth in place",
